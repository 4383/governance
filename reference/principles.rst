==================
Guiding Principles
==================

OpenStack has a set of guiding principles that are used to inform and shape
decisions. These principles are not aspirational. Rather, they form the
bedrock upon which the OpenStack community and software are built.

First and foremost, OpenStack follows :doc:`opens`. All four of
them are essential, and most of the principles described in this document
derive from them. In their personal interactions, our community members
are also bound by the rules described in the
`OpenStack Community Code of Conduct
<https://www.openstack.org/legal/community-code-of-conduct/>`__.

One OpenStack
-------------

OpenStack is one community with one common mission, producing one framework
of collaborating components. Our organization into separate source code
repositories and teams allows contributors to focus on their areas of
interest and expertise, but does not make OpenStack a loose collection of
disconnected projects.

OpenStack First, Project Team Second, Company Third
---------------------------------------------------

OpenStack leaders are expected to put the needs of OpenStack first in
their decision making, before the needs of any individual project team.
They are also expected to put the needs of their project team before the
needs of the organization they work for, if any. They can of course
represent the needs of their project team or their company, but in case
of conflicts of interest, they should be ready to put those needs aside
and make the best call for OpenStack as a whole.

Representative Democracy
------------------------

While we strive to build community consensus around decisions, all decisions
are finally made or delegated by people who have been democratically elected.

One Contributor, One Vote
-------------------------

The voice of the contributor community is essential, and forms the basis
of our democracy. A person with a thousand patches in an OpenStack release
should not have a voice a thousand times as strong (and writing patches is
not the only way to contribute). Efforts to limit the electorate to those
who make quantifiable contributions, no matter the form, are intended only
to prevent gaming of the system, not as a value judgement on relative worth
of the various different forms of community contributions.

Changes in Leadership are Good
------------------------------

It is important for the long-term health of OpenStack that its democratically
elected leaders change over time to remain representative of the body of
contributors. OpenStack does not have and does not want any sort of dictator,
benevolent or otherwise. Leaders (and other community members) in OpenStack
are encouraged to participate in mentoring activities (external or internal
to the OpenStack community) to help cultivate the next generation of
contributors and leaders. No one should consider their role as permanent.
Leaders, specifically, should consider stepping down from their role when
they can't fully focus on it anymore, and always ensure a good transition
path with their successors.

OpenStack is Built for our Users
--------------------------------

OpenStack is ultimately built to be deployed and used. We need to factor the
needs of our existing and anticipated users (operators but also application
developers) when making decisions.

Empowering Businesses, on a Level Playing Field
-----------------------------------------------

From the beginning, OpenStack has striven to support businesses who build
products on or with OpenStack, and help them be successful. However,
OpenStack should not empower one business over another, or else our community
would not truly be a place where everyone can collaborate. While the needs of
the constituent businesses are essential, they must be balanced with each other
lest OpenStack decisions unwittingly be made by unelected people behind
closed doors.

Contribution Is Our Currency
----------------------------

Change happens in OpenStack because anyone in the community can identify an
issue and volunteer to do the necessary work. Contribution is the mechanism
of change and how trust is built between community members. Though elected
leadership exists, that leadership is not solely responsible for change.
The entire OpenStack community is empowered to identify problems and, where
possible, assemble the teams to resolve them.

OpenStack Primarily Produces Software
-------------------------------------

While the software that OpenStack produces has well defined and documented
APIs, the primary output of OpenStack is software, not API definitions.
We expect people who say they run "OpenStack" to run the software produced by
and in the community, rather than alternative implementations of the API.

We all should Always Follow the OpenStack Way
---------------------------------------------

No one is outside of the rules. We derive considerable value from the
empowerment that everyone in the community enjoys from equal application
of our key values, principles, and common processes. If parts of OpenStack
exist outside of the rules, everyone suffers. While it can be tempting to
circumvent process for expedience, doing so is not scalable from a community
perspective. It leads to the subversion of democracy and an abdication of our
principles of Open Design and Open Community. Large code changes designed
outside of community processes, and decisions made outside of OpenStack
governance are generally rejected because they, by definition, did not
include the community.

OpenStack Leaders Exist to Serve Their Community
------------------------------------------------

OpenStack leaders hold their positions only in order to serve the people
they lead. The TC only exists to serve the technical community. PTLs
exist to serve the contributors to and users of their projects.

Participation is Voluntary
--------------------------

The leadership of OpenStack should not need to find itself in a position
of enforcing the rules because participation in the OpenStack community is
a choice made by its participants in the first place. If you disagree with
the principles or processes we follow, we encourage you to either participate
in improving them within our community governance rules, or seek a different
community that is better aligned with your ideals or opinions.
