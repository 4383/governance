.. _`tag-vulnerability:managed`:

=======================
 vulnerability:managed
=======================

This tag is part of the vulnerability-classification system for
vulnerability reporting and tracking across project
deliverables. ``vulnerability:managed`` indicates that a
deliverable's vulnerability report reception and disclosure are
handled directly by the OpenStack Vulnerability Management team
(VMT).


Application to current deliverables
===================================

.. tagged-projects:: vulnerability:managed


Rationale
=========

The VMT is building out automation and reporting for vulnerability
management processes in order to better accommodate the rapid growth
of the OpenStack ecosystem. In an order to scale availability of
its processes beyond its current charter and capacity, a formal
acknowledgement of the list of project deliverables directly
handled by the VMT (rather than managed independently by individual
project teams) is best maintained through application of a
governance-related tag.


Requirements
============

* There are currently no defined criteria for application of this
  tag, as selection has been managed previously on an ad-hoc basis
  by the members of the VMT. In the future it is expected that
  actual application criteria will be added here, but for the time
  being this tag simply serves to document the existing scope of
  official vulnerability management within OpenStack.


Tag application process
=======================

Anyone may propose adding or removing this tag to a set of
deliverables by proposing a change to the openstack/governance
repository. The change is reviewed by the VMT and Technical
Committee and approved using standard resolution approval rules,
including discussion at at least one Technical Committee public IRC
meeting.


Deprecation
===========

The ``vulnerability:managed`` tag should only be removed from
deliverables under extreme circumstances, when the VMT is no longer
able to adequately handle these vulnerabilities. Care should be
taken to only discontinue vulnerability management for future
non-patch releases, while continuing to handle vulnerabilities on
already existing ``stable`` release branches if at all possible
until such time as they reach end-of-life.
