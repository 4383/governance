========================
 Top 5 help wanted list
========================

This document lists areas where the OpenStack Technical Committee seeks
contributions to significantly help OpenStack as a whole. While in most
cases things happen naturally through the normal contribution dynamics
in the community, in some cases a `tragedy of the commons`_ is at play.
Guidance, leadership and proper recognition of efforts is therefore needed
to encourage individuals or organizations to contribute in areas where they
could make a big impact.

Each item should clearly explain why the item matters (value of the effort
to the community, operators and users), why we need help there (description
of the current situation) and what experience or benefit the volunteer can
expect to gain from tackling it. It should also include the name of a TC
sponsor (responsible for evangelizing, articulating and channelling the work,
but also facilitating connections between candidates and target teams). For
an estimate of the commitment required, interested candidates should reach
out to the TC sponsor, or the PTL of the affected project.
