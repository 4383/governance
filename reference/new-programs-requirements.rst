 Minimal Requirements for New Programs Applications
======================================================

Teams in OpenStack can be created as-needed and grow organically. As the team
work matures, some technical efforts will be recognized as essential to the
completion of the OpenStack project mission. By becoming an official Program,
they place themselves under the authority of the OpenStack Technical
Committee. In return, their contributors get to vote in the Technical
Committee election, and they get some space and time to discuss future
development at our Design Summits. When considering new programs, the TC will
look into a number of criteria, including (but not limited to):

- Scope

  - Team must have a specific scope, distinct from others teams scope
  - Team must have a mission statement

- Maturity

  - Team must already exist, have regular meetings and produce some work
  - Team should have a lead, selected by the team contributors
  - Team should have a clear way to grant ATC (voting) status to its
    significant contributors

- Deliverables

  - Team should have a number of clear deliverables
