 OpenStack Technical Committee
===============================

The OpenStack Technical Committee is one of the governing bodies of the
OpenStack project. It is an elected group that represents the contributors
to the project, and has oversight on all technical matters.

The Technical Committee is formally defined in the
`OpenStack Foundation bylaws`_ (in particular article 4.1(b), article 4.13
and Appendix 4) and further refined in the :doc:`reference/charter`.

Upstream work under the Technical Committee is organized under official
:doc:`reference/projects/index` and more informal `Working Groups`_.

These pages contain OpenStack Technical Committee reference documents
and track official resolutions voted by the committee.
